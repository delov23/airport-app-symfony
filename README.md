## Basic idea of the Controllers, Services, Repositories
- Security -> login, logout
- Authentication -> create/reset-pass
- User -> register/profile(my trips)
- Admin -> admin-panel/promote-to-admin
- Route -> create/edit/delete/view/view-all
- Flight -> create/edit/delete/view/view-all/schedule

## Views (highlights)
- Flight Schedule ```Shows departures and arrivals from the previous day till the next one```
- Reset Password Email ```Sending a well-formated email to reset a password```
- 404 Page ```For production```
- Responsive landing page ```Main things to do in the site```
- A large admin panel ```Things you can do with the app```
- Forms ```Interactive despite not having a SPA Front-end```
